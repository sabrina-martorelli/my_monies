## My_Monies

My monies is a financial tracker and dashboard created with React and Material UI. 
It was part of the final project for the Trilogyâ€™s Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development(edX).
The colour palette and general style was modified for this version.  
## Description

The app allows to add transactions to 10 different categories : Bills, Charity, Eating out, Entertainment, Expenses, Groceries, Holidays, Savings, Shopping, Transport. 

The new transactions will be stored on the local storage . 

Base on the information stored the dashboard will show different charts , graphics and tables with calculate data.
